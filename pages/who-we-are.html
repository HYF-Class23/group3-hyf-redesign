              HackYourFuture's focus on providing coding education to
              individuals with limited access to education and the labor market,
              especially refugees, plays a crucial role in empowering them with
              valuable skills for the digital age.

              We envision a world where education and quality jobs are
              accessible to all. That's why we've created a free 34-week program
              tailored for refugees and newcomers, breaking barriers and
              fostering equal opportunities.
